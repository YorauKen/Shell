# C++ Shell

This project is a C++ implementation of a Unix-like shell, inspired by the basic operations found in popular Unix shells like Bash. It serves as an extended upgrade to the original C implementation by [Stephen Brennan](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/).

## Features

- **ls**: List directory contents.
- **cd**: Change the current directory.
- **cp**: Copy files or directories.
- **history**: Display command history.
- **help**: Display help information.
- **clear**: Clear the screen.
- **exit**: Exit the shell.

## Usage

To compile the shell, use the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
```
and execute the shell exe/out file generated
```bash
./shell
```
